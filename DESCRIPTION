Description: The "caret" package is common in various tasks related to machine learning; 
    however, it does yet ship dedicated time series models. This implementation thus
	extends the "caret" package and offers additional models, including ARMA or ARIMA. 
	Additionally, it customizes the "train" function to accept time series data.
